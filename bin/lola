# This is NOT the real lola command. It is here to catch a bad setup.
#
# The `lola` command is a shell function, that is created by `lola-init`. So
# the fact that we ended up here, means that the user ran the `lola` command in
# a shell where `lola-init` had not been run. Usually that happens at startup,
# so this means that Lola has not been properly setup.
#
# We'll take this opportunity to explain to the user how to fix things.

# Get absolute path of lola bin directory:
srcpath=$(cd ${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/bin/*}; echo $PWD)

# Write out error message.
