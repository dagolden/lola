== Core Concepts

* Lola depends on 2 environment variables: LOLA_SRC and LOLA_ROOT.
* LOLA_SRC is the directory containing the Lola repo.
  * Also contains plugin repos under $LOLA_SRC/plugin/
  * LOLA_SRC is static content
  * Upgrading Lola is just (cd $LOLA_SRC; git pull --recurse-submodules)
  * I(ngy) would set LOLA_SRC to `~/src/lola`
* LOLA_ROOT is where stuff gets written to or installed
  * $LOLA_ROOT/conf is the config file
  * $LOLA_ROOT/lang is where languages get installed
  * $LOLA_ROOT/bin is where are shims are installed
  * LOLA_ROOT defaults to $HOME/.lola
* All the above happens is automated into one startup line:
  * source /path/to/lola/bin/lola-init
* Your current directory determines your runtime settings
  * Including your package (module) settings
* Per directory settings are kept in ./.lola/
  * If not found in cwd, traverse back up to / looking for .lola/
  * Can optionally be stored in $LOLA_ROOT/lola/${PWD//\/:}
* General command format is:
  * lola [<lang-id>] <action> <options> <args>
  * lang-id can be omitted (use one from previous command)
