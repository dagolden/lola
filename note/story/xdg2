XDG User Story #2: Project-specific perl development

I'm working on a project.  When I'm in the project directory, I want to be
using a particular version of perl.

I want to be able to easily install all my dependencies from a cpanfile
into a local library and then run my code/test using that library.  For
example, I might use carton to create a cpanfile.snapshot file with a
particular set of dependencies installed into local/.

Right now, I have to remember to switch my perlbrew to the right perl and I
have to run "carton exec $command @args" to have the local library set up
correctly.  I'd much rather be able to run "perl" or "prove" or
"bin/app.pl" and have the perl and library automatically set up correctly
based on some configuration within the directory.
