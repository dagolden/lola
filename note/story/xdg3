XDG User Story #3: Application deployment

I want to deploy a web application to a web server.

Using my configuration management tools, I install my desired perl binary
into /opt/perl/v5.18.1, owned by root and read-only.

Using git, I clone my application repository into /opt/myapp.  The
application contains a cpanfile.snapshot for use with carton.  I use carton
to install dependencies into the local/ directory.

I need to create an init.d script that runs the application as the "myapp"
user using the /opt/perl/v5.18.1 I've installed and the local/ library
within /opt/myapp.

The application includes some scripts to be run regularly by the "myapp"
user's crontab.  The cron jobs need to run the scripts using the same perl
and local/ library that the application runs.

If I have another application (or a later version of "myapp" that I'm
testing), I want to install it similarly into /opt/otherapp and run it and
any associated jobs as the "otherapp" user.  It might use the same
/opt/perl/v5.18.1 perl or a different one.
