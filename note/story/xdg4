XDG User Story #4: Command line app deployment

I want to deploy some command line applications to a server for use
by an administrator over ssh.

Using my configuration management tools, I install my desired perl binary
into /opt/perl/v5.18.1, owned by root and read-only.

I create an admin user "toor".  I want to /opt/perl/v5.18.1 to be toor's
default Perl.  I want to install some CPAN App::* modules into a local
library in /home/toor.  Commands issued over SSH need to find those App::*
scripts in the path and run them with the correct perl and library.

I have some private command line applications that I install into
/opt/bigcli from a git repository.  I want to choose which perl gets used
for bigcli.  I install dependencies (possibly frozen with Carton) into
/opt/bigcli/local.  I want "toor" to be able to run /opt/bigcli/bin/bigcli
and have it use the right perl and the /opt/bigcli/local libraries.

The toor user might need to run bigcli from a cron job or other script.
Those also need to use the right perl and libraries.

In all these cases, the CWD would not necessarily be either toor's $HOME
or /opt/bigcli.  The commands need to work from any CWD.
